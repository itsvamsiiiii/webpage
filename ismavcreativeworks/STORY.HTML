        Shiva don't act like sleeping, have your dinner.<br>
        I'm getting late for movie friends are waiting" Mahima said .
        <br>
        "0k," shiva said.
        <br>
        "And yes, please pick me from office sharp 10'o clock at the mall" Mahima said <br>
        
        "0k baby, please let me sleep now," shiva said.<br>
        
        "0k then, I leave now". Mahima said <br>  Mahima took an auto to reach the mall
        and asked the driver if he could run fast because she is
        already very late.<br>
        The driver told Mahima that he knows a shortcut from
        where we can reach quickly to the mall.<br>
        Mahima permit to take the short cut but she
        was unaware of the danger.<br>
        That road was deserted.<br>
        Mahima felt threatened when she saw the road.<br> The
        driver stopped the auto after going some distance and
        said that the auto has broken down.<br>
        Mahima said "please do something, I have to reach
        the mall as quick as I can."<br>
        Then two bike riders came there and tried to touch
        Mahima.<br>
        "What is this, can't you see," Mahima said in anger.<br>
        The bikers stopped and pulled Mahima by her hair.<br> One of
        they pushed Mahima down and grabbed her legs.<br>
        Mahima kept protesting but they had no effect of her
        crying.<br>
        Then Mahima recollects her all power and kicked one
        of them badly in his stomach and he started crying with
        pain, another friend pan to see his friend.<br>
        Mahima picked her handbag and took the knife out.<br>
        One of them moved toward her and she stabbed him
        in the neck and he died on the spot.<br>
        Another one started crying and pleads Mahima to leave,<br>
        But Mahima didn't listen and stabbed him too in the
        neck.<br>
        Bad people chapter ends,respect woman don't mess with them<br>
